#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-3895" href="#v560-note-3895">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* @ralekseenkov added a web runtime flag `CONCOURSE_SECRET_CACHE_DURATION_NOTFOUND` to set a
  separate caching interval when a secret is not successfully found in the config store.
  Defaults to 10s. Addresses [#3895](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/3895) #4009.

* @thoHeinze added `CONCOURSE_GARDEN_NETWORK_POOL` as configurable flag in BOSH release.
  Defaults to Garden's range of 10.254.0.0/22. Addresses [#4153](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/4153).

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-4311" href="#v560-note-4311">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* Credentials fetched from a credential manager will now be automatically redacted from build output, thanks to a couple of PRs by @evanchaoli! [#4311](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/4311)

  Please don't rely on this functionality to keep your secrets safe: you should continue to prevent accidental credential leakage, and only treat this as a safety net.

  > NOTE: In its current form, credentials that get 'split' into multiple `write()` calls will not be redacted. This may happen for large credentials, or if you're just unlucky. Work to improve this is in-progress: [#4398](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/4398)

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-4387" href="#v560-note-4387">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The cluster name can now be added to each and every log line with the handy dandy `--log-cluster-name` flag, available on the `web` nodes. This can be used in a scenario where you have multiple Concourse clusters forwarding logs to a common sink and have no other way of categorizing the logs. Thanks again @evanchaoli! [#4387](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/4387)

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-4236" href="#v560-note-4236">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* To pin a version for a resource on `get` step, the `set-pipeline` command for fly will now take only string value in key-value pair of given version. [#4236](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/4236)

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-4348" href="#v560-note-4348">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* The [fly `set-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-set-team) documentation when running `--help` previously suggested that a list is a valid input to any auth configuration flags. This, however, was not the case where it actually only accepts a single value per flag and if you want to configure multiple, you need to pass them individually using separate flags. The [fly `set-team`](https://concourse-ci.org/managing-teams.html#fly-set-team) help documentation will now clearly describe that each flag only accepts a single value, thanks to @niall-byrne! [#4348](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/4348)

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-43" href="#v560-note-43">:link:</a></sup></sub> feature

* @joshzarrabi and @aemengo added `CONCOURSE_GARDEN_MAX_CONTAINERS` as configurable flag in BOSH release.
  Defaults to 250. Please note that setting this limit over 250 has not been tested by the Garden team or the Concourse team.

#### <sub><sup><a name="v560-note-4442" href="#v560-note-4442">:link:</a></sup></sub> fix

* `/opt/resource/out` scripts in resources could previously crash `atc` instances by outputing `null` to `stdout`, causing a nil pointer dereference. The `atc` now checks for a nil value and, if one is found, returns before dereferencing the pointer. [#4442](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/pull/4442)
